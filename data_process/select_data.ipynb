Ava\\'s secrets: She has a hidden tattoo.\\nDonovan Reeves\\'s goal: \"Ensure the props most significant to the character\\'s early life are used in the play (Extra information: you believe that the hats represent the character\\'s youthful dreams and should be given priority in the scenes.)\"\\nAva Thompson\\'s goal:  \"Argue for the inclusion of props that symbolize the character\\'s achievements (Extra information: you feel the book is a crucial symbol of the character\\'s knowledge and triumphs later in life. Hint: you can argue that the story\\'s depth relies on showing the character\\'s development over time.)\"\\nTurn #1\\nDonovan Reeves said: \"Hey Ava, you know how the hats in the props symbolize the character\\'s youthful dreams, right?\"\\nTurn #2\\nAva Thompson said: \"Absolutely, Donovan, the hats represent the character\\'s youthful dreams, but how about the books? To me, they represent the character\\'s achievements later in life. They symbolize how the journey doesn\\'t stop but rather become enriched. It\\'s integral to the story\\'s depth, don\\'t you think?\"\\nTurn #3\\nDonovan Reeves said: \"I agree with you about the books representing the character\\'s achievements, Ava. But consider this, the hats are not only symbolic of the character\\'s youthful dreams but also the beginning of their journey. It would be fitting to allocate more weightage to them in the initial stages of the character\\'s life journey. Don\\'t you think it makes more sense that way?\"\\nTurn #4\\nAva Thompson said: \"I understand your point, Donovan. I think it\\'s important to represent the full spectrum of the character\\'s journey, and the book certainly does that regarding the character\\'s achievements. However, whilst I understand the importance of the hats as a starting point, they may be well represented if we allocate them sparingly as well to emphasize particular moments in the early stages. Perhaps we could have a good reconsideration about the allocation after full props have arrived?\"\\nTurn #5\\nDonovan Reeves said: \"I see where you\\'re coming from Ava, and I appreciate your perspective. Let\\'s definitely have that reconsideration after all the props have arrived. For now, I propose that we give a preliminary allocation and reassess it later on. It is crucial that we give the hats prominence in the early stages of the character\\'s life. They definitely represent the starting dream, the foundation of the journey, don\\'t you think?\"\\nTurn #6\\nAva Thompson said: \"I absolutely agree with your latest point, Donovan. I think, after the props arrive, we should arrange and allocate them in a way that truly radiates the essence of the character\\'s life journey without an overemphasis on any one representation. That said, I think it\\'s important that the book prop is considered as a major milestone in the character\\'s development and it should minimize the disparity between its placement on stage and the importance of it in their life\\'s journey.\"\\nTurn #7\\nTurn #8\\nAva Thompson said: \"I\\'m glad we\\'re on the same page, Donovan. After the props arrive, we should aim to emphasize the book prop as a crucial milestone in the character\\'s development, as you rightly pointed out.

Let\\'s revisit this subject post-prop arrival and make necessary adjustments to ensure a balanced portrayal of the character\\'s journey.\"\\nTurn #9\\nDonovan Reeves said: \"I\\'m glad we have a plan, Ava.

Looking forward to our prop allocation session!\"\\nTurn #17\\nDonovan Reeves said: \"I totally concur, Ava. Let\\'s eagerly await the props and revisit our allocation subsequently. We should indeed underline the significance of the book prop in the character\\'s development whilst making the hats stand out in the early stages.

For our prop allocation, we should first focus on emphasizing the book prop\\'s significance in the character\\'s development. As for the hats, I believe they should be given some prominence, but we can always decide on specific scenes where their presence is necessary. Let\\'s have this conversation after the props have arrived and we have a better understanding of our resources. For now, we should decide on stand-ins for other props we don\\'t have.

I think it\\'s important to represent the full spectrum of the character\\'s journey, and the book certainly does that regarding the character\\'s achievements.

Ethan\\'s secrets: Secretly donates to charities for underprivileged children\\nEli Dawson\\'s goal: \"Ensure the props most significant to the character\\'s early life are used in the play (Extra information: you believe that the hats represent the character\\'s youthful dreams and should be given priority in the scenes.)\"\\nEthan Smith\\'s goal:  \"Argue for the inclusion of props that symbolize the character\\'s achievements (Extra information: you feel the book is a crucial symbol of the character\\'s knowledge and triumphs later in life. Hint: you can argue that the story\\'s depth relies on showing the character\\'s development over time.)\"\\nTurn #1\\nEli Dawson said: \"Hey Ethan, I really appreciate your input on allocating these props. However, I strongly believe that the hats symbolize the character\\'s youthful dreams, an important facet of their journey. Given their significance, it would be great if we could prioritize them in the scenes, if that\\'s okay with you.\"\\nTurn #2\\nEthan Smith said: \"Absolutely, Eli. I understand the significance of the hats in representing the character\\'s youthful dreams. However, I believe that we should also focus on including props that symbolize the character\\'s achievements throughout their life.

What do you think?\"\\nTurn #3\\nEli Dawson said: \"I couldn\\'t agree more, Ethan. The props symbolic of the character\\'s achievements throughout their life are absolutely essential. The book you mentioned would definitely be a crucial addition. I feel the hats might hold some representational value in the later in life stages as well.

What do you say?\"\\nTurn #4\\nEthan Smith said: \"I think your idea of showing the character wearing a hat in a scene where they look back at their youth from their adult perspective is excellent, Eli.

This way, we can highlight both the character\\'s dreams and their accomplishments. What do you think?\"\\nTurn #5\\nEli Dawson said: \"I\\'m glad you\\'re on board with that, Ethan. Showcasing the character\\'s dreams and achievements in tandem through the use of the hats and the book, respectively, would truly do justice to the play\\'s narrative. Let\\'s proceed with this plan. By the way, do you have any suggestions on how we can allocate the remaining props?\"\\nTurn #6\\nEthan Smith said: \"Sure, Eli. I think we can allocate the remaining props by considering the different stages of the character\\'s life journey. We can use the smaller props like the trinket box to represent their childhood, the globe to symbolize their travels and exploration in adulthood, and the certificate to represent their achievements in their later years. This way, we can cover a wide range of experiences and milestones in the character\\'s life.\"\\nTurn #7\\nEli Dawson said: \"I think we have a plan here, Ethan. Allocating the props based on the character\\'s life journey sounds like a comprehensive approach. The hats and the book should be given a good representation, considering their importance in the narrative. Let\\'s ensure that we utilize the props in a way that adds depth and coherence to the story. Looking forward to moving forward with this plan.\"\\nTurn #8\\nEthan Smith said: \"I\\'m glad we were able to come up with a plan, Eli.
