Ava Thompson's goal:  "Negotiate to use more of your own parts in the assembly

incorporates both sets of parts while respecting each other's preferences.)"
Conversation Starts:

Donovan Reeves said: "Hey Ava, I'm glad we finally got our hands on the missing 
parts. How about we start by discussing our ideas for assembling the furniture 
together?"
Ava Thompson said: "{"description": "Hey Donovan, how about we swap our top 
halves so we can make the most of the different designs we've brought? I think 
this could work really well.", "title": "Negotiation Proposal"}"
Donovan Reeves said: "That's an interesting idea, Ava. Swapping the top halves 
could indeed create a unique and visually appealing design. However, I believe 
it would be best if we focus on using more of my parts for the assembly. The 
quality of my parts is superior, and I'm confident that they will make the 
furniture more durable in the long run. What do you think?"
Ava Thompson said: "I understand where you're coming from, Donovan. However, as 
much as I respect the quality of your parts, I also believe that using a 
combination of our designs could result in a visually unique and interesting 
final product. Could we give this a shot?"
Donovan Reeves said: "I understand your perspective, Ava, but I really believe 
that using more of my parts would be the best option for durability. My parts 
are of higher quality and I want the furniture to last. Perhaps we can 
compromise and find a way to incorporate more of my parts while still keeping 
some of the unique design elements you suggested. What do you think?"
Ava Thompson said: "I appreciate the thoughtfulness in your decision, Donovan, 
but spending some time together with our combined designs might just yield a 
unique and intriguing result, from an aesthetically and scheme perspective. 
Let's take it from there."
